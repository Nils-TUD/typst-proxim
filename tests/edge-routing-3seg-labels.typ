// Test: label-pos distance semantics for 3w routing.
// The middle segment (seg 2) is the default.
//   3w-north/south: seg 2 is horizontal → positive dist = north, negative = south
//   3w-east/west:   seg 2 is vertical   → positive dist = east,  negative = west
// Both 3w-north and 3w-south with the same positive dist must place their
// labels on the same (north) side of the horizontal middle segment.
